## TODO LIST

### Top Priority

- NGLObject3D grouping - Problem on `lookAt`
- Organize the bounding box collision. (Unproject and collision algorithms are OK)
- Identify the collision over the mesh's surface
- Finish the gesture recognition
- 3D geometry comrpession.


### Low Priority

- Animated Texture (multiple images with ### pattern)
- Primitives Plane, Sphere, Piramid
- NGLParseMesh::defineStructure is very expensive with NSDictionary. Find a faster way.
- Render Lines and Points
- Eliminate the redundant calls at Variables Update
- Make relative rotation updates Absolute rotation
- Interactive API (Touch)
- When Morph, Buffers update and fix all mess between NGLES2Mesh and NGLES2Buffers.
- Cell Shading
- Bump Level
- Cube Map
- Real Time Reflection
- Sharpness
- Animation
- Skinning
- Physics
- Parse 3DS
- Parse TGA image format
- Automatically flip PVRTC
